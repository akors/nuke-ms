/** @defgroup clientnode Communication Protocol
 *
 * This Module is used as the client side of a server-client connection.
 * It handles lookup, connect/disconnect operations as well as sending and
 * receiving data from/to a server.
 *
 * The main class of this module is the @ref clientnode::ClientNode class, please refer to its
 * documentation for information on how to use this module.
 *
 * The ClientNode is supposed to be reentrant, so in theory you should be able
 * to create multiple instances of it without the possibility of interference
 * between them.

/** Client Communication Protocol.
 *
 * Use this class to create a black box that handles all the network stuff for
 * you.
 *
 * To use it, simply create an instance of this class using the constructor
 * ClientNode().
 * Upon creation, the ClientModule will be initialized and ready to connect to
 * a server.
 * Then you will have to set up callbacks that inform you of the
 * result of connection attempts, send attempts and incoming messages. To
 * register callbacks use the functions connectRcvMessage(),
 * connectConnectionStatusReport() and connectSendReport().
 * You can then post connection/disconnection requests
 * (connectTo(), disconnect()) and send messages (sendUserMessage()).
