This is the release-notes file of nuke-ms. In here you can find information 
important changes to the project concerning both users and developers.


============  nuke-ms 0.2   ------------------------  23 Apr 2011  =============

---- Application users

  * It is now possible to chat with clients from different operating systems.
    This is because text is now encoded using UTF-8 instead of UTF-16/UTF-32.
    

---- Library users

  * Minimal Boost version is raised to 1.39. This is due to the inclusion of 
    Boost.Signals2, see below.
    
  * In this release, for the first time, parts of nuke-ms can be used as 
    libraries that can be used in other applications. 
    
    The first library to be released is the "clientnode" library, which provides
    functionality to any client connecting to a nuke-ms network.
    You can build it a static as well as a shared library, depending on the 
    CMake variable BUILD_SHARED_LIBS that can be specified on the command line.
    Documentation for the nuke-ms API is provided in the doc/html/ subdirectory.
    

---- Developers

  * You can now compile Boost.Asio as a seperate library to reduce code size,
    compile time and code redundancies. To do so, set the CMake variable 
    BOOSTASIO_OWNLIB to ON.

  * Building shared libraries is now supported. Set the CMake variable 
    BUILD_SHARED_LIBS to on.
    
  * Building with the src/ subdirectory as CMake top-level-dir is now 
    unsupported. Build with the top level directory instead.
    
  * You can now build the API documentation, provided you have doxygen
    installed. An "apidoc" target is provided which can be used to create the
    documentation.

  * Seperated the network component from the client application, this is now a 
    library and called "clientnode"

  * Boost.Signals2 is now used for signals and callbacks to/from the clientnode.
    this version of the Signals library is included in Boost since 1.39, so we
    have to raise the minimum Boost version.
    
  * The client/control has died. No glue between network and gui is needed 
    anymore, since the gui now instantiates the clientnode itself.


---- Lookout to the next version

This section sets goals to achieve until the next version of nuke-ms. However,
these goals might change over time. Some might be added and some dropped.

  * New server infrastructure:
    - The current server implementation is to be scrapped and the server 
      application shall be rewritten from scratch.
    - The new architecture should provide a robust (and hopefully small) 
      framework for server applications that will be based on pluggable 
      libraries that provide the actual functionality.
    - As a demonstration of the new pluggability, an "alias" module shall be
      created that receives, stores and distributes alias'es to different 
      clients.

  * GUI improvements
    - It should not be neccessary to know any textual commands, the GUI should
      feature the necessary interface to the user to connect, disconnect and
      send messages.
