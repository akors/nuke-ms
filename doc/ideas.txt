Chat Mutex - Participants can send messages only subsequently. If Bob 
currently holds the mutex, Alice cant send anything. However, she can ask
Bob for the mutex (button). If bob does not explicitly declines, Alice gets
the mutex.

Drag &n Drop support for file transactions

Configurable key bindings, which produce all kinds of actions, such as 
entering predefined phrases in the window.
 
Chatroom Namespaces:
The chatroom space of a server is grouped into a hierarchical structure.
Each room can have other rooms but still can be used for communications.
A server can "mount" another server under a location in the hierarchy.
 
File Transfer facilities


Command and message history - accessible with PageUp/PageDown.
Implementation:
Maintain queue with messages, add new messages (OnEnter), remove if
size is too big (number of messages? size variable?)
When typing message and hitting PageUp, message is also appended to the 
queue.

GUI- Additions:
"Connection" Menu: 
 - Connect -> Dialog (Server, port)
 - Disconnect
"File" Menu: Quit
"Help": About...


User Identification:
User identifies not by classical "username/password", but by "private/public"
keypair. 
Problem: On webs of servers it is difficult to address users on a different
servers, because the adresses assigned might not be unique. A username@server
approach is not feasible, because users would start to depend on the single
server they are registered in, and that is not what we want.
A keypair is more secure than username/password when handled properly, 
but the primary advantage is that on webs of servers a more or less unique
identification is provided. Also this approach allows proper authentication and
encryption of endpoints between each other.
